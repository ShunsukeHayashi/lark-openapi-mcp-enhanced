Using npm as the preferred package manager. Found multiple lockfiles for /Users/shunsuke/Dev/lark-openapi-mcp-enhanced. To resolve this issue, delete the lockfiles that don't match your preferred package manager or change the setting "npm.packageManager" to a value other than "auto".

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you resolve the multiple lockfiles issue by removing the lockfile that doesn't match your preferred package manager (npm). Let me first check what lockfiles exist in your project.

I can see that you have both `package-lock.json` (npm) and `yarn.lock` (yarn) files in your project. Since you're using npm as your preferred package manager, I'll remove the `yarn.lock` file to resolve the conflict.

Perfect! I've removed the `yarn.lock` file from your project. Now you only have the `package-lock.json` file, which matches your preferred package manager (npm). This should resolve the multiple lockfiles warning you were seeing.

The project will now use npm consistently, and you shouldn't see that warning message anymore when working with your project.

_**Assistant**_

I understand you want to remove the Devin extension. However, I don't have the ability to directly manage VS Code extensions or other development environment extensions from this interface.

To remove the Devin extension, you'll need to do this manually in your development environment:

## For VS Code:
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to the Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Devin"
4. Click on the Devin extension
5. Click the "Uninstall" button

## For other IDEs:
- **Cursor**: Similar to VS Code, go to Extensions and uninstall Devin
- **JetBrains IDEs**: Go to Settings/Preferences → Plugins and uninstall Devin
- **Other editors**: Check the extension/plugin management section

## Alternative methods:
- **Command line** (if available): Some extensions can be uninstalled via terminal commands
- **Extension manager**: Use your IDE's built-in extension manager

Once you've uninstalled the Devin extension, you may need to restart your development environment for the changes to take effect.

Is there anything specific about the Devin extension that was causing issues, or do you need help with any other aspects of your project setup?
