## Key Metrics

### Coverage Improvement by Module Type

| Module Type | Initial Coverage | Current Coverage | Improvement |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Storage | 0% | 80.63% | +80.63% |
| Genesis Utils | 56.16% | 98.63% | +42.47% |
| Core Utils | 0% | ~98% | +98% |
| MCP Tool Utils | 14.75% | 52.45% | +37.70% |

### Test Distribution

| Module | Tests Added | Test Categories |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| conversation-storage.ts | 35 | Unit, Integration, Error Handling |
| gemini-client.ts | 9 | Async, Retry Logic, Error Cases |
| rate-limiter.ts | 26 | Algorithm, Metrics, Edge Cases |
| rate-limited-http.ts | 37 | HTTP, Rate Limiting, Mocking |
| case-transf.ts | 14 | Transformations, Edge Cases |
| filter-tools.ts | 35 | Filtering Logic, Combinations |
| get-should-use-uat.ts | 25 | Token Modes, Edge Cases |

### Testing Patterns Established

1. **Comprehensive Mocking**
   - External dependencies (sqlite3, fs, crypto, axios)
   - Complex SDK structures (Lark SDK)
   - Module-level singletons

2. **Edge Case Coverage**
   - Null/undefined handling
   - Empty arrays/strings
   - Invalid inputs
   - Boundary conditions

3. **Real-World Scenarios**
   - Actual API patterns
   - Common use cases
   - Error recovery paths

4. **Bilingual Documentation**
   - Chinese comments in tests
   - English/Chinese test descriptions
   - Maintains project conventions

## Lessons Learned

1. **Mock Early, Mock Completely**: Comprehensive mocking setup prevents test failures and enables true unit testing
2. **Edge Cases Reveal Bugs**: Testing edge cases discovered the off-by-one error in retry logic
3. **Fake Timers for Async**: Jest fake timers are essential for testing time-dependent async operations
4. **Module Architecture Matters**: Well-structured modules are easier to test
5. **Incremental Progress**: Focusing on one module at a time yields better results

## Next Steps

1. Complete handler.ts tests with proper Lark SDK mocking
2. Expand to remaining utils modules (http-instance.ts, constants.ts)
3. Begin testing agent modules (currently at 0%)
4. Fix discovered bugs (gemini-client retry logic)
5. Update deprecated APIs (crypto.createCipher)

## Conclusion

Through systematic TDD approach, the project's test coverage has more than doubled from 5.89% to approximately 12.5%. Each testing phase not only improved coverage but also:
- Discovered implementation bugs
- Established reusable testing patterns
- Created comprehensive mock setups
- Documented expected behaviors

The journey demonstrates that TDD is not just about coverage numbers, but about building confidence in the codebase through systematic validation of functionality.
