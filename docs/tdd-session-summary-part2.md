# TDD Session Summary - Part 2

## Date: 2025-07-02

### Overall Progress
- **Total Coverage**: Improved from 30.24% to 36.53% (+6.29%)
- **Tests Added**: 83 new tests across 5 test files
- **Modules Covered**: MCP Server (3 modules) and Genesis Core (2 modules)

### Coverage Improvements by Module

#### 1. MCP Server Modules
- **mcp-server/stdio.ts**: 0% â†’ 100% âœ…
  - Created 5 comprehensive tests
  - Covers STDIO transport, connection handling, error scenarios
  
- **mcp-server/sse.ts**: 0% â†’ 100% âœ…
  - Created 15 tests
  - Covers SSE endpoints, session management, multiple clients
  
- **mcp-server/shared/init.ts**: 0% â†’ 100% âœ…
  - Created 16 tests
  - Covers initialization, configuration, tool setup, rate limiting

#### 2. Genesis Core Modules
- **genesis/core/data-extractor.ts**: 0% â†’ 79.23% ðŸ“ˆ
  - Created 24 tests
  - Covers JSON extraction, table parsing, list parsing, schema validation
  - Remaining uncovered: Some edge cases in table/structured parsing
  
- **genesis/core/prompt-engine.ts**: 0% â†’ 100% âœ…
  - Created 23 tests
  - Covers full command stack execution, dependency handling, error cases
  - Complete coverage achieved

### Key Patterns Established

#### 1. Mock Strategies
- **External Dependencies**: Consistent mocking of SDK modules
- **Console Mocking**: Capturing logs and errors for verification
- **Process Exit**: Safe mocking of process.exit for error handling tests

#### 2. Test Organization
- **Describe Blocks**: Logical grouping by functionality
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive coverage including error paths
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Tests that mirror actual usage patterns

#### 3. Coverage Focus Areas
- **Happy Path**: Basic functionality verification
- **Error Handling**: Exception and error response testing
- **Configuration**: Various option combinations
- **Boundary Conditions**: Null checks, empty arrays, edge values

### Technical Achievements

1. **100% Coverage Modules**: 4 out of 5 tested modules achieved perfect coverage
2. **Complex Mock Scenarios**: Successfully mocked Express apps, SSE transports, and AI clients
3. **Async Testing**: Proper handling of promises and async operations
4. **Type Safety**: Maintained TypeScript strict mode throughout

### Remaining High-Priority Tasks

1. **mcp-tool core module (mcp-tool.ts)** - 0% coverage
2. **Rate limiting utilities** - 0% coverage
3. **Genesis CLI** - 0% coverage
4. **Lark Base builder integration** - partial coverage

### Lessons Learned

1. **Test-First Benefits**: Writing tests revealed a null-check bug in data-extractor
2. **Mock Complexity**: MCP SDK modules require careful mock setup
3. **Coverage vs Quality**: High coverage achieved while maintaining test quality
4. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation for module behavior

### Next Steps

Continue with the high-priority task of testing the mcp-tool core module, which is critical for the MCP tool functionality and currently has 0% coverage.

## Metrics Summary

| Module | Files | Tests | Coverage Before | Coverage After | Improvement |
